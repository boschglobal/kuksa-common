## Pre-commit set up
This repository is set up to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.
Use `pip install pre-commit` to install pre-commit.
After you clone the project, run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your git hooks.
Pre-commit will now run on every commit.
Every time you clone a project using pre-commit running pre-commit install should always be the first thing you do.
